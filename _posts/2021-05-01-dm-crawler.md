title: A crawler to check webpages to see if a product became available to order.

In early spring 2021, the shops in Germany have just started selling covid-19 testing kits.
The demand was high, and one would need to update websites often to get some.
So I created a small crawler that checked the webpages of DM and Aldi to check whether the "Order" button became available.
