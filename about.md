### About me

I live in Berlin and work as a backend engineer. I spend my free time bouldering, playing the piano and teaching others programming.

My favorite books are `If on a Winter's Night a Traveler` and `What I Talk About When I Talk About Running` (long names are great).

My favourite professional books are `Introduction to Algorithms` and `Documenting APIs`.

I mainly created this website too play around with static site generators, GitHub Pages and ML art. 

### Credits

This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I took [Hitchens Theme](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens) as a basis and tweaked it to my needs.

The picture of me is generated from a photo with [Stylized Neural Painting model](https://jiupinjia.github.io/neuralpainter/).
